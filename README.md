Interactive Photo Gallery

Interactive image galleries are a common feature of many websites, from photo sites to e-commerce applications. Using HTML, CSS and the popular programming language JavaScript, I've created an interactive, searchable gallery of photos.
Once the user begins typing the title of the entry, JS filters the photos to show only photos with the correlating string.
